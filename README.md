# Drum Kit Project

## Overview
This project is a fun and interactive Drum Kit implemented using JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate HTML and CSS elements. Users can play different drum sounds either by clicking on the drum images or by pressing the corresponding keyboard keys. 

The Drum Kit is not only a creative application to explore the potential of web audio, but also serves as a learning tool to understand core concepts of JavaScript and DOM manipulation. It's an excellent playground to dive into event handling, audio control and CSS transitions.

## Features
- Interactive drum kit with distinct drum sounds.
- Users can trigger drum sounds by clicking on the drum images or by pressing the keyboard keys associated with each drum sound.
- Engaging visual feedback in the form of CSS transitions on key press or mouse click.
- Responsive design to make the Drum Kit accessible on various devices.

## Technologies
- JavaScript: The core functionality of the drum kit, including event handling and audio control, is implemented in pure JavaScript.
- HTML/CSS: HTML and CSS are used to create and style the drum kit interface. The project utilizes CSS transitions to provide a dynamic user experience.
- DOM Manipulation: JavaScript is used to actively manipulate the DOM, changing styles and triggering audio playback based on user input.

## Usage
1. Launch the application in your web browser.
2. Click on the drum images to play the corresponding drum sound. 
3. Alternatively, you can use your keyboard to play the drum sounds. Each drum image displays the keyboard key that triggers the sound.
4. Enjoy playing the drum kit and feel free to mix and match different sounds!
